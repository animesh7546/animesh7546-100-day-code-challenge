Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of 
a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. 
It is the easiest searching algorithm
Follow the given steps to solve the problem:
Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index.
If x doesnâ€™t match with any of the elements, return -1.
Given an array arr[] of N elements, the task is to write a function to search a given element x in arr[].
Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 110
Output: 6
Explanation: Element x is present at index 6
Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 175
Output: -1
Explanation: Element x is not present in arr[].
Time complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
