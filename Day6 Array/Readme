You have been given a random integer arraylist(ARR) of size N and an integer X. You need to search for the integer
x in the gievn arraylist using 'Linear search'. You have been  required to return  the index at which X is present
in the arraylist. If X has multiple occurences in the arraylist, then you need to return the index at which the 
first occurences of X would be encountered. In case X is not present in the arraylist, then return -1. 
'Linear search' is a method for finding an element within an arraylist. It is sequentially checks each element of
the arraylist until a match id found or the whole arraylist has been searched.
