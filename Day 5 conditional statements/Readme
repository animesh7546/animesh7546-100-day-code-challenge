Sample Input 1 :
2
10000 A
4567 B
Sample Output 1 :
17600
8762
Explanation For Sample Input 1:
Test Case 1:
We have been given the basic salary as Rs. 10000. We need to calculate the hra, da and pf. 
Now when we calculate each of the, it turns out to be:
hra =  20% of Rs. 10000 = Rs. 2000
da = 50% od Rs. 10000 = Rs. 5000
pf = 11% of Rs. 10000 = Rs. 1100

Since, the grade is 'A', we take an allowance of Rs. 1700.
On substituting these values to the formula of totalSalary, we get Rs. 17600 and now rounding it off will result in Rs. 17600 and hence the Answer.

Test Case 2:
We have been given the basic salary as Rs. 4567. We need to calculate the hra, da and pf. 
Now when we calculate each of the, it turns out to be:
hra =  20% of Rs. 4567 = Rs. 913.4
da = 50% od Rs. 4567 = Rs. 2283.5
pf = 11% of Rs. 4567 = Rs. 502.37

Since, the grade is 'B', we take an allowance of Rs. 1500.
On substituting these values to the formula of totalSalary, we get Rs. 8761.53 and now rounding it off will result in Rs. 8762 and hence the Answer.
