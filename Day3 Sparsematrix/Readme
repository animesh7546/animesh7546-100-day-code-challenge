A matrix is a two-dimensional data object having m rows and n columns, therefore a total of m*n values.
If most of the values of a matrix are 0 then we say that the matrix is sparse. Consider a definition of Sparse
where a matrix is considered sparse if the number of 0s is more than half of the elements in the matrix.
To check whether a matrix is a sparse matrix, we only need to check the total number of elements that are equal 
to zero. If this count is more than (m * n)/2,we return true. 
Input : 1 0 3
        0 0 4
        6 0 0
Output : Given Matrix is a sparsematrix
There are 5 zeros. This count
is more than half of matrix
size.
Input : 1 2 3
        0 7 8
        5 0 7 
Output : Given Matrix is a sparsematrix        
Time Complexity: O(m*n) 
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
